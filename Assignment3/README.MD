# Assignment Three - Online Grocery Membership Prototype

## Description
This assignment is meant for you to exercise the skills you've developed in CIDM2315 and CIDM3312 such that you implement a quick prototype of the Online Grocery Delivery project (from assignments one and two) with at least two ASP.NET 5.0 MVC/Razor views/forms which perform support the business transactions of the system with an emphasis on CRUD operations on the underlying model.  This is by no means meant to be a complete application, rather, this is meant to demonstrate to me that you have the basic skills to be productive.  I am providing you with some guidelines/constraints for the project.

## Requirements
* Create at least two ASP.NET 5.0 (using Razor pages or MVC) form/views that utilize a local SQLite database (DB file)
* These forms/views should show the function of a business transaction from the broader Online Grocery Delivery application.
* Each form should facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your underlying model
* Each form should be from a different actor's perspective

## Pairing
* Select another student in the course to partner with; Perhaps that could be somebody you worked with in Assignment 2.
* Install the CodeTogether extension for Visual Studio Code. 
* Arrange to spend at least two hours working on this assignment project together as a Pair Programming exercise. 
* Provide a report of that experience along with the code for this assignment. 

Watch this video to get a sense of what Pair Programming is meant to be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-x-T34z9w

Also, trade places during the exercise where one of you is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator" as Lucy Bain explains in that video.

You will prepare a one-page report outlining what advantages and disadvantages you experienced during pairing.

While the requirement is to spend a minimum of the two hours, you are welcome to continue to pair for a longer duration.

## Deliverables
* ZIP up code project directory
* Pair Retrospective and Review report
